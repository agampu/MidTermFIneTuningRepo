## Model Performance Summary

We compared the original `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model with the its finetuned version using the ragas generated query/prompt data (`finetuned-prompt-retriever`).

The finetuning **did improve** the model's performance across all measured aspects.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Overall Similarity:** The finetuned model was slightly better (around **3.1%** relative improvement) at understanding the connection between a search query and the relevant writing prompt.
*   **Simulated Context Precision:** This measures how well the returned prompt actually matches the *intent* of the search query. The finetuned model showed a **2.4%** relative improvement here.
*   **Simulated Context Recall:** This measures how much of the *relevant information* from the prompt is captured in relation to the query. The finetuned model improved by **3.1%** here (the highest relative gain).
*   **Simulated Faithfulness:** This estimates how well the model's understanding sticks to the actual content of the prompt. There was a **2.0%** relative improvement.
*   **Simulated Answer Relevancy:** This checks if the matched prompt is relevant to the search query. The finetuned model improved by **2.8%** here.

### In simple terms:

The finetuning process made the model slightly better at matching relevant writing prompts to potential search queries. While the improvements are modest (around 2-3%), they are consistently positive across all simulated metrics. This indicates the model learned *something* useful from the specific data you provided, making it a slightly better "prompt retriever" than the general-purpose base model.
